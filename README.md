# My Personal Portfolio (Under Construction)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! Though the site is currently under construction.

## About Me (Coming Soon)

I'm a student at Warwick (CS BSc) and have a passion for real estate, gaming and jiu jutsu.  I'm currently working on showcasing my projects and experience here.  Stay tuned for updates!

## What to Expect (Eventually)

This portfolio will eventually feature:

*   **Projects:** A showcase of my projects, including both personal and academic.
*   **Skills:** A list of my technical skills and areas of expertise.
*   **About:** A more detailed introduction to my background and passions.
*   **Contact:** Information on how to get in touch with me.

## Current Status

The site is not actively being developed (small side project) . I'm not working on anything particular, most of the stuff i will be working is in the navigation bar, and if a seciton is incomplete i will probably be  working on that.
